# nyu-gis-metadata

This is the practice metadata repository for NYU's GIS records. Eventually, this repository will be cloned into the main OpenGeoMetadata repository.

Each file is placed in a subfolder that is the first 4-digit number in the handle.net URL, and each file is the unique 5-digit number after the second slash.

We will structure this in the layers.json file as well.
