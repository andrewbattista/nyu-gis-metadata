# nyu-gis-metadata

This is the practice metadata repository for NYU's GIS records. Eventually, this repository will be cloned into the main OpenGeoMetadata repository.

Each file is placed in a subfolder that is the first 4-digit number in the handle.net URL followed by the second five-digit number after the second slash. 

Every geoblacklight file is named geoblacklight.xml and when appropriate other original metadata records will be added into this repository.

We will structure this in the layers.json file as well.
