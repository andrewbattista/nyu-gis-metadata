# nyu-gis-metadata

This is the staging metadata repository for NYU's GIS records. Metadata records are placed here, then pushed to Ichabod, and eventually cloned into the main OpenGeoMetadata repository.

Each file is a geoblacklight.json and ahderes to the following root structure:

name of collection in one word / first 4 digits of handle url / last 5 digits of handle URL / geoblacklight.json

example:

nyu-gis-metadata/pilot/2451/33920/geoblacklight.json

Every geoblacklight file is named geoblacklight.json and when appropriate other original metadata records will be added into this repository.

We will structure this in the layers.json file as well.
