A Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) consists of a U.S. county or counties or equivalent entities associated with at least one core (urbanized area or urban cluster) with a population of at least 10,000 along with any adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core. CBSAs are categorized as being either Metropolitan or Micropolitan. Each Metropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants. Each Micropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urban cluster of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population.","dc_rights_s":"Restricted","dct_provenance_s":"NYU","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34082\",\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://archive.nyu.edu/bitstream/2451/34082/2/nyu-2010USCoreBasedStatisticalAreas.zip\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\":\"http://maps-restricted.nyusdr.net/geoserver/nyu_sdr/wfs\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\":\"http://maps-restricted.nyusdr.net/geoserver/nyu_sdr/wms\"}","layer_id_s":"nyu_sdr:nyu-2010USCoreBasedStatisticalAreas","layer_slug_s":"nyu-2010USCoreBasedStatisticalAreas","layer_geom_type_s":"Polygon","layer_modified_dt":"2015-8-7T15:9:14Z","dc_format_s":"Shapefile","dc_language_s":"eng","dc_type_s":"Dataset","dc_publisher_s":"Environmental Systems Research Institute (Redlands, Calif.)","dc_creator_sm":[],"dc_subject_sm":["United States--Statistics","United States--Administrative and political divisions","Metropolitan areas"],"dct_isPartOf_sm":"ESRI 10 USA Census","dct_issued_s":[],"dct_temporal_sm":["2010"],"dct_spatial_sm":["United States of America"],"dc_relation_sm":["http://sws.geonames.org/6252001/about/rdf"],"georss_box_s":"24.7073204053 -170.1769013405 71.6032483233 -64.5665435791","georss_polygon_s":"24.7073204053 -170.1769013405 71.6032483233 -170.1769013405 71.6032483233 -64.5665435791 24.7073204053 -64.5665435791 24.7073204053 -170.1769013405","solr_geom":"ENVELOPE(-170.1769013405, -64.5665435791, 71.6032483233, 24.7073204053)","solr_year_i":2010}
